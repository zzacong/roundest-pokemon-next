# Roundest - Which Pok√©mon is most round?

Answering all of life's toughest questions

## Why?

Why not. I [streamed most of the creation of this project if you're curious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKy2lYEnhgs). Regardless of how you feel about the idea, I think the technical details of this implementation are worth learning from.

## Getting Started

Prerequisite:

- MySQL local database (or Planetscale connection using PScale CLI)
- npm

Setup

1. Clone repo
1. `npm install`
1. Create `.env` file if one does not already exist
1. Add connection URLs for both database and shadow db to .env ([example .env file here](https://gist.github.com/TheoBr/e450c52a52a9f9c9b49ef07212689685))
1. Initialize database - `npx prisma migrate dev`
1. Initialize base data set - `npm run ts-node ./scripts/fill-db.ts`
1. Run dev server `npm run dev`

## TODO

- [x] Use next/image to handle image caching and better rendering
- [ ] Persist data fetched from PokemonAPI
- [ ] Create the results page with counting/sorting
- [ ] Better loading state between votes
